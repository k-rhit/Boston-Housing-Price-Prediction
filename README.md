# Boston-Housing-Price-Prediction

Housing prices are influenced by various socio-economic and geographical factors. The Boston Housing Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the median house prices in different areas of Boston. By analyzing these factors, we can understand the key drivers of real estate prices and help home buyers, sellers, and policymakers make informed decisions.

Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a regression model that can predict the Median Value of Owner-Occupied Homes (in $1000s) based on 14 different features describing the neighborhood and housing conditions.

The dataset consists of 506 observations with 14 numerical attributes, including independent variables (features) and one dependent variable (target variable).

1. CRIM- Per capita crime rate by town
2. ZN- Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots (over 25,000 sq. ft.)
3. INDUS- Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
4. CHAS- Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
5. NOX- Nitrogen oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM- Average number of rooms per dwelling
7. AGE- Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
8. DIS- Weighted distance to five Boston employment centers
9. RAD- Index of accessibility to radial highways
10. TAX- Property tax rate per $10,000
11. PTRATIO- Pupil-teacher ratio by town
12. B- Racial composition (1000(Bk - 0.63)^2, where Bk is the proportion of Black residents)
13. LSTAT- Percentage of lower status population
14. PRICE- Target Variable: Median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s)
